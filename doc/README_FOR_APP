==Capansis Authentication

Capansis Authentication is web service that allows you to easily implement a very secure and robust authentication system into your 
application.  It provides a fully RESTful API using XML over HTTP and is secured using HTTP Basic Authentication.

==Site Domain and API Key

In order to incorporate Capansis Authentication into your application, you will first need a valid domain and API key, such as:

Domain: capansis.com
API Key: c144dccfa6d57711185083fb0336dcfa9b33ac61

These credentials can then be used as a username and password via HTTP Basic Authentication 
(e.g. http://capansis.com:c144dccfa6d57711185083fb0336dcfa9b33ac61@authentication.capansis.net) to interface your application with the 
authentication service, or to login to the administration panel.

==Making Requests to Capansis Authentication

Requests to Capansis Authentication are made through URL's and HTTP verbs.  The URL represents a resource within the authentication service 
(i.e. an Account), while the verb describes how you would like to interact with it.  There are four different verbs used.

===Get
Will retrieve a object from the authentication service, such as getting a users account information.

===Post
Will add a new object into the system, such as registering a new user or logging an existing user into the system.

===Put
Will change an existing object within the system, such as a user updating their email address or changing their password.

===Delete
Will remove an object from the system.

These methods are used to interact with two objects via the API.

===Account
Represents the account for a user.

===Login
Represents the authenticated session for a user.

==Accounts

There are seven ways to interact with the Account resource.

===Getting A Collection of Accounts

To get a full collection of all users for a given site:

<tt>curl -X GET -u domain:api_key http://authentication.capansis.com/accounts.xml</tt>

You can also filter the collection by the first letter in a accounts email address by passing the the letter parameter:

<tt>curl -X GET -u domain:api_key http://authentication.capansis.com/accounts.xml?letter=a</tt>

===Getting A Single Account

To get a single account, pass the accounts id:

<tt>curl -X GET -u domain:api_key http://authentication.capansis.com/accounts/123456.xml</tt>

If the account cannot be found, Capansis Authentication will return an error 404 Record Not Found error.

===Creating A New Account

To create a new account with Capansis Authentication, you must pass a new record via a POST request to the Account resource:

<tt>curl -X POST -u domain:api_key -d "account[email_address]=name@domain.com&account[password]=password&account[password_confirmation]=password" http://authentication.capansis.com/accounts.xml</tt>
